  * Updateed configure script as requested by CRAN.
  
Changes from version 1.4.1 to 1.4.1-1:
  * Changed citation information.
  
Changes from version 1.3.8 to 1.4.1:
  * CRAN no longer allows mixing C++ and C flags for OpenMP. 
    Therefore the CRAN version no longer supports OpenMP. 
    You can download the OpenMP-supported version from Github 
    https://github.com/helske/Rlibeemd or install it directly with 
    devtools::install_github("helske/Rlibeemd") (needs devtools package).
  * S-number criterion is now more robust by explicitly checking the
	  signs of minima and maxima. This partially undoes the changes done
	  for version 1.3 of libeemd.
	* Bivariate EMD is now supported, see function bemd.
  * Functions fail properly in case sifting doesn't seem to converge.
  
Changes from version 1.3.7 to 1.3.8:

Changes from version 1.3.6 to 1.3.7:
